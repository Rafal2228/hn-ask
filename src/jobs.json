We’re\nlooking to build more robust pipelines to transform raw, often human-entered\ndata into standards-compliant forms, and to deploy a wide variety of machine\nlearning/AI models in a scalable, traceable manner.\n\nSenior Software Engineer Web: We are building out a web platform for clients to\nconnect to our platform. This will be a clean-sheet ground-up build and we are\nlooking for someone who can lead that project. Eventually we will hire more for\nthis area, right now we’re looking for the first engineer to lay the groundwork\nand build initial prototypes.\n\nWe need several engineers at 2-3 year and at senior/tech lead level.\nRequirements for more senior positions shift more toward demonstrated ability to\narchitect and lead projects. In all cases though we look for independence, a\nstrong sense of craft, and solid technical skills.\n\nGeneral Process (based on candidate we make small tweaks):\n\n1.) Phone screen for resume\n\n2.) Short take-home problem\n\n3.) Phone conversation about take-home\n\n4.)

The Transit team is responsible for the\ninfrastructure relating to the transit of data - this includes caching,\nmessaging, queueing, and application routing (nginx). We're slowly transitioning\nto be more of a \"tier one\" team, which means that we'll be responsible for those\nsystems and more - service discovery, site performance, and more.\n\nWe're looking for someone to help us maintain these systems and, possibly more\nimportantly, determine the right path for an AWS migration. One of my favorite\nparts of this job is that we get to work incredibly closely with engineering\nteams to help them choose the right tools for the job, and then help them\nimplement their use cases around those tools. Our ideal applicant doesn't\nnecessarily have experience with any of these tools, but they do have general\nops and/or application engineering experience and are willing and excited to\nlearn the other side. Ideally you're also excited to mentor - a big component of\nthis job is working with engineering teams and helping them build with the\ninfrastructure in mind.\n\nI find the best way to explain our team is to share some of the problems we've\nbeen working on:\n\n# Redis Performance For legacy reasons, we're running multiple instances of\nredis on a single VM. They've recently started clobbering each other in\ncompetition for disk i/o. We've been working on various projects to migrate to\nnew hardware, split the multiple instances to different VMs, and reduce or\nremove the usage of redis entirely.\n\n# Site Routing As we move more services to AWS, we've had some complications\nwith how we route web requests. How can we ensure the same routing expectations\nare met in AWS as they are in our on-prem datacenter without massively\nincreasing our operational burden, and having multiple different systems\nperforming the same task in different datacenters?\n\n# Network Traffic Reduction Or, as we've taken to calling it, \"the service call\ndiet\". This is primarily manifesting as a change in how we make use of our\ncaching systems (other than redis). Some of our services make hundreds of calls\nto memcache for a single request. This means that any sort of network latency\ncan be magnified 100x over. We've been working with engineering teams to provide\ncaching best practices and to build out a new internal caching library to\nsimplify and abstract our caching infrastructure.\n\nIf this sounds like something you'd be interested in, please email me at\ntylerl@surveymonkey.com.

We\ndiscuss past mistakes openly so we can adapt our processes to the challenges\nthat come with progress. Puns flow freely across our San Francisco office as\nwell as on Slack, and we have remote engineers spanning six different time\nzones.\n\nOur engineering team [1] prides itself on code quality and innovation. We use\nthe cutting-edge Elm programming language for all our new front-end code, and\nhave been migrating legacy React code to Elm as well. Our back-end is primarily\nRuby on Rails, although we are working to split off smaller services as we scale\nto keep up with our traffic. You can read about our experiences with these\ntechnologies on our team blog! [2]\n\nIn addition to spending work hours open-sourcing useful libraries we develop\n[3], we also invest financially in open source. We hired the creator of Elm,\nEvan Czaplicki, to develop Elm full time. [4] Evan discusses his plans for the\nlanguage with the team every week, periodically pairs with other engineers on\nElm, and cracks up members of the sales team with his lunchtime jokes.\n\nWe use Amazon AWS for our infrastructure and automate all of our deployments\nusing Chef and OpsWorks. We write a lot of tests, and use Jenkins for continuous\nintegration. Our process for new features begins with our product team and\nin-house visual designer, continues with a GitHub pull request from a feature\nbranch into master, and ends with our in-house QA specialist trying to break it\nbefore it reaches production.\n\nWe’re looking for engineers who want to work on a mission that makes a\ndifference and who are the type of collaborators that value kindness and\nopen-mindedness, over convincing the group they’re right.\n\nYou can learn more about what to expect through blog posts about our interview\nprocess [5] and on-boarding experience [6].\n\nIf you’re interested, please apply through our jobs page! \nhttps://www.noredink.com/jobs [https://www.noredink.com/jobs]\n\n[1] https://www.noredink.com/about/team [https://www.noredink.com/about/team]\n\n[2] http://tech.noredink.com/ [http://tech.noredink.com/]\n\n[3] https://github.com/NoRedInk/ [https://github.com/NoRedInk/]\n\n[4] http://tech.noredink.com/post/136615783598/welcome-evan\n[http://tech.noredink.com/post/136615783598/welcome-evan]\n\n[5] http://tech.noredink.com/post/145260396603/our-engineering-h...\n[http://tech.noredink.com/post/145260396603/our-engineering-hiring-process]\n\n[6] http://tech.noredink.com/post/143787279069/on-boarding-as-a-...\n[http://tech.noredink.com/post/143787279069/on-boarding-as-a-new-remote-engineer-think-about]","position":"Full-Stack Engineers, Site Reliability Engineers, and Engineering Managers","remote":true,"minSalary":null,"maxSalary":null,"currency":null},{"by":"nfriedly","commentId":18808274,"company":"Tanium","description":"Tanium | Emeryville, CA (SF) or Morrisville, NC (RTP) or REMOTE | INTERNS\nhttps://www.tanium.com/careers/?gh_src=qprker8f1\n[https://www.tanium.com/careers/?gh_src=qprker8f1]\n\nTanium's product is basically computer security & management software for\ngovernment and large enterprises.

In truth,\nwe are pioneering a new model of corporate culture, and learning as we go.\n\nFor example, as Angelina Kwan, chief operating officer of BitMEX, put it: “In\naddition to being a true market leader among trading platforms, BitMEX shares my\nvalues of gender inclusion, particularly in STEM fields.
