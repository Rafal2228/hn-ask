We have a system in production that reads/writes smart contracts in\nEthereum's Solidity language, and we use it to ensure our customer's code is\nsecure and correct. Eventually, we plan on going far beyond smart contracts.\nThink of what we are building as a compiler that takes code and translates it to\ntheorem proving, so that we can build automation that can understand code almost\nas close to a human. If it can understand code, with sufficient compute it can\n“synthesize” it.\n\nIn Oct 2018, we raised $5.6M from Y Combinator, Khosla Ventures and Pantera\nCapital [6].

You’ll identify\nwhen an engineering solution is needed (i.e., throw across a cluster of\nmachines), or when an algorithmic improvement is required. You might even play\nwith the Z3 theorem prover [3]. And if you’re really into it, you can improve\nZ3.\n\n# Software engineer: Smart contracts — You’ll be working on the “front-end of\nthe compiler”, which reads in smart contracts languages (e.g., Solidity) and\nmakes it accessible to the backend (the part that does semantic analysis).\nDesire to work at the compiler level of smart contracts is required, e.g., see\n[4] — experience in writing smart contracts is easily acquired as a side effect.\n\nContact: saurabhs@synthetic-minds.com - Saurabh, Founder\n\n[1] Synthetic Minds Jobs: https://synthetic-minds.com/pages/jobs.html\n[https://synthetic-minds.com/pages/jobs.html]\n\n[2] Program synthesis: \nhttps://medium.com/@vidiborskiy/software-writes-software-pro...\n[https://medium.com/@vidiborskiy/software-writes-software-program-synthesis-101-294a9a35177]\n\n[3] Z3 Theorem Prover: https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3\n[https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3]\n\n[4] Solidity AST: \nhttps://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/libsolidit...\n[https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/libsolidity/ast/AST.cpp]\n\n[5] Solidity smart contracts: \nhttps://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.4.21/solidity-by-examp...\n[https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.4.21/solidity-by-example.html]\n\n[6] Forbes funding article: \nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/darrynpollock/2018/10/22/invest...\n[https://www.forbes.com/sites/darrynpollock/2018/10/22/investment-boost-for-synthetic-minds-helps-build-automated-smarter-smart-contracts/#6c1994462a63]","position":" First 5 engineers:\ncommensurate equity ","positionTags":["Engineer"],"remote":false,"minSalary":120000,"maxSalary":120000,"currency":"USD"},{"by":"perrylouniverse","commentId":19283851,"company":"Adacado ","description":"Adacado | Senior Developer | Vancouver, BC, Canada | ONSITE | Full-timeYou have\nover 5 years of coding and web application expertise in a senior role, and want\nto do more innovative development and MUCH less mundane operations support.\n“Creating Change is what we do.”\n\nAdacado is looking for expert programmers to enrich our development skill pool\nand help take our application to the next level, innovatively and technically.\nYou’re the type of developer that is never satisfied.
